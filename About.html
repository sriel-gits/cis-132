     <section> <p>My Name is Israel Uko, I am a CIS Major who is interested in pursueing a carrer in web development. 
        I am 20 year old Nigerian and I have been schooling in America for a year since august 2023.But before coming the 
        United states i have been interested in tech, an dwas also an art student pecifically everyday gadgets like phones, laptops and so on. 
        Tech reviews have been my thing for years watching some of the leaing tech enthusiasts like MRwhosetheboss and MKBHD,
        I could not what for another review from them. Although i do not watch them as much I used to, I head to their channel from time to time. 
        Apart from being a twin one intersting about me is that i can joggle objects the max i can do are 3 tennis balls using both my hands and two on one hand.
        oh! I'm also better than you in ping pong.</p></section>
